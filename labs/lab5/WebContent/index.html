<h1>Lab 5 - JSPs</h1>

<p>Welcome to a servlet-less webapp!</p>

<p>Servlets are java code that surrounds HTML (and other things).  
JSPs are "inside-out" servlets, that is, they are HTML that can have java code embedded in it.</p>

<p>This page is an html page (as opposed to other labs), our lab JSP is called <a href="example.jsp">example.jsp</a></p>

<p>Read through example.jsp, visit example.jsp a bunch of times (refresh it a bunch) observe the behavior of the counters, then come back here.</p>



<h2>Examples</h2>
<div class="examples">
<p>Paste an example of a directive from example.jsp here.  <strong>leave off the angle brackets, that is &lt;<span style="color:red">copy the part between the angle brackets</span>&gt; so that it shows up here</strong></p>
<div class="answer directives">
