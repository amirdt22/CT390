A lab on JavaBeans

Reading: Chapter 14

It follows the standard lab format:
* pull down the lab from git to your eclipse environment
* run the lab
* follow the prompts
* make and test/view your changes (by running the lab again)
* export and submit your lab

Make sure you fix your build path in eclipse before starting.
